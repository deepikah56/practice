<p style="text-align:center">"The hotel is arranged on three floors, without a lift. On the ground floor, apart from the reception, there is a comfortable lounge where you can sit and drink tea, or just read. There is also a splendid terrace, where, you can relax and immerge yourself from morning onwards in the atmosphere of Venetian daily life, watching the city travelling about by water and people gathering together and filling the alleyways and little squares with their chatter.
The rooms are arranged on the first, second and third floors. On the top floor, there is also a delightful terrace or solarium available for the use of guests, from where you can enjoy the wonderful view."
